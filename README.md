### Game Objective

The goal of Prophunt is simple: **players are split into two teams, Hunters and Props**. Props disguise themselves as various objects in the environment to avoid being detected by Hunters, while Hunters must find and eliminate the hidden Props before time runs out.

### Teams and Roles

- **Props:** You start as a random object in the game environment. Your job is to blend in with other similar objects and avoid detection.
- **Hunters:** Your goal is to find and eliminate all Props before the time limit expires. Use your surroundings and sharp eyes to spot anything that seems out of place.

### Game Flow

1. **Game Start**: At the start of each round, players are assigned to the Prop or Hunter team.
2. **Props Hide**: Props find a hiding spot and disguise as an object in the environment.
3. **Hunters Seek**: Hunters must find and eliminate the Props before the time expires.
4. **Winning Conditions**:
   - **Props win** if at least one Prop remains hidden when time runs out.
   - **Hunters win** if all Props are eliminated before time expires.

## Technical Information

This game is built on **GEngine**, which utilizes an **Entity Component System (ECS)** for performance and flexibility. The ECS design allows for the efficient handling of game objects (Entities) with components like movement, rendering, input, and more. This structure enables fast, scalable gameplay and makes it easy to add new game mechanics.
